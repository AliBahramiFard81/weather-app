# main

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

this is a test app to work with flutter and api.

note that you can only send 50 requests per day and if the app stopped refreshing the data its because you have reached your daily requests.
to bypass the limit ypu can always create a new app on accuWeather and copy your api key and paste it in the app in the settings page.
